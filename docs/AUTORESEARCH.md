# CASP16 Autoresearch Notes

This is the working index for agent-driven CASP16 strategy iteration. The
benchmark is the protocol; strategy code and run directories are the only place
where methods should change.

## Current Truth

- `casp16_protein_v1` is a local protein-first leaderboard, not the official
  CASP16 server leaderboard.
- Current local ranked set: 39 targets, split into 16 protein-domain targets
  and 23 protein-oligo targets.
- Current official score-table target sets: 71 protein-domain targets and 104
  protein-oligo targets.
- To compare against CASP16 server groups going forward, use
  `casp16_server_protein_v2_aliasfix` instead of rewriting
  `casp16_protein_v1` or the already-used v1 server artifacts.
- `casp16_server_protein_v1` now has a generated skeleton: 175 fixed official
  targets, 106 Protenix jobs, 54 cached references, and 45 unresolved parsed
  domain-subtarget diagnostics.
- `casp16_server_protein_v2_aliasfix` is now generated: 175 fixed official
  targets, 163 Protenix jobs, 79 cached references, 67/71 domain inputs ok,
  and 96/104 oligo inputs ok. It is the default benchmark for future
  winner-comparison claims.
- `leaderboards/casp16_server_protein_v1/official_groups.csv` is server-only;
  `leaderboards/casp16_server_protein_v2_aliasfix/official_groups.csv` is the
  alias-fixed server-only baseline; each version keeps `official_all_groups.csv`
  as a diagnostic.
- Server scoring now enforces metric identity: `GDT_TS` for domains and
  `QSglob` for oligos. DockQ cannot rank server oligo targets.
- Current metric-tool probe: `TMscore` and `USalign` are present in the protein
  conda env; OpenStructure `ost` is installed at
  `/scratch/10992/liaorunlong93/conda/envs/ost-qsglob/bin/ost` and is the
  default QSglob-compatible scorer. The first H0220 probe returned
  `status=ok` but `QSglob=0` because automatic chain/chem mapping failed, so
  assembly mapping is now the bottleneck for affected targets.
- A six-target QSglob signal probe across the four completed server-v1
  Protenix dev runs produced nonzero scores on `H0222` and `T1249V1O`; QSglob
  is useful for strategy triage, but `H0220` remains a clear unmapped false-zero
  risk.
- Current best local server-domain `dev_fixed` run:
  `server_protenix_yang_terminal_tag_cleanup_seed101`, mean `0.066908`.
- `server_protenix_yang_antibody_fv_cleanup_seed101` is a negative
  `dev_fixed` result on domains (`0.060677`) and remains unranked on oligos
  in the checked-in artifacts generated before QSglob scorer installation.
- Multi-candidate work now has a separate policy:
  `docs/SERVER_ATTACK_POLICY.md` and
  `attack_budgets/casp16_server_attack_protenix5.json`.
- A larger planned attack tier now exists as
  `attack_budgets/casp16_server_attack_protenix25.json`: v2 alias-fixed
  benchmark, seeds `101..125`, one sample per seed, confidence-only selector,
  and five predeclared seed shards. Shard run ids and seed ranges are locked in
  `attack_budgets/casp16_server_attack_protenix25_shards.tsv`. It is not queued
  yet.
- Single-seed `dev_fixed` rows are for debugging and ablations only. Any claim
  about chasing CASP16 server winners must report the attack budget, candidates
  per target, selector, and GPU cost.
- First attack run spec:
  `server_attack_protenix_terminal_tag_seed101_105`, using terminal-tag cleanup
  inputs with seeds `101..105` and `protenix_confidence_v1`.
- Queued second attack run spec:
  `server_attack_protenix_coverage_stoich_seed101_105`, using the stacked
  sequence-recovery + large-target fallback + token-safe stoichiometry inputs
  with the same five-candidate `protenix5` budget. It is not submitted yet.
- New coverage-recovery strategy:
  `yang_large_target_split_or_fallback_v1`, which predeclares a token-budget
  fallback for the eight known Protenix `n_token > 2560` failures.
- New sequence-recovery strategy:
  `yang_sequence_recovery_v1`, generated on top of terminal-tag cleanup, repairs
  protein-domain inputs that were missing or locally misparsed as DNA/RNA.
- New stacked coverage strategy:
  `yang_sequence_recovery_large_target_fallback_v1`, generated on top of
  terminal-tag cleanup, combines sequence recovery with token-budget fallback.
  It is queued as
  `server_protenix_yang_sequence_recovery_large_target_fallback_seed101`,
  changes 40 unique targets, and keeps every optimized job under the 2560
  Protenix token limit.
- New exact-stoichiometry artifact:
  `yang_oligo_stoichiometry_recovery_v1` restores official parsed
  `Oligo.State` for protein-only oligo jobs where server inputs collapsed to
  one copy per entity. It changes 9 existing jobs; 5 stay under the Protenix
  limit and 4 require construct/domain-window handling.
- New token-safe stoichiometry strategy:
  `yang_oligo_stoichiometry_token_safe_v1`, generated on top of stacked
  coverage recovery and queued as
  `server_protenix_yang_oligo_stoichiometry_token_safe_seed101`, restores exact
  copy counts for 5 under-budget oligo jobs while keeping the largest
  optimized job at 2535 tokens.
- New v2 baseline candidate:
  `server_v2_protenix_yang_coverage_stoich_seed101` is submitted as Slurm job
  `810938` with dependency on v1 attack job `810719`. It targets
  `casp16_server_protein_v2_aliasfix` and uses the same
  `yang_oligo_stoichiometry_token_safe_v1` transform regenerated on v2,
  producing 163 jobs with 10 changed targets and no recovered job above the
  2560-token limit.
- New H1258 target-lab artifact:
  `target_lab/h1258_interaction_window_v1/` builds the public
  LRRK2-interaction-window clue as LRRK2 residues 861-1014 plus 14-3-3 A1B2.
  It is 648 tokens and must stay out of ranked workflows until generalized.
- New small-complex target-lab batch:
  `target_lab/small_complex_stoich_batch_v1/` combines 5 under-budget exact
  stoichiometry complexes with the H1258 interaction-window job for faster
  learning before full-benchmark promotion. It has been submitted as Slurm job
  `810824` and now has `summarize_outputs.py` plus `score_dockq.py` for
  post-run diagnostics.
- New domain-fragment target-lab batch:
  `target_lab/domain_fragment_batch_v1/` turns the domain-decomposition recipe
  into 12 runnable Protenix fragment jobs. It has been submitted as Slurm job
  `810862` and must stay out of ranked server comparisons.

## Main Objective

Improve automatic CASP16 protein prediction strategies while preserving a
stable, fair leaderboard. The near-term target is not to claim a win from the
small local v1 leaderboard, but to construct a server-compatible benchmark and
then improve methods against that harder target set.

## Current Method Baseline

The best current OpenDDE local run is an engineering baseline on
`casp16_protein_v1`. It improves local coverage and score, but it does not beat
the CASP16 official or server baselines. Treat it as a launch point for
strategy iteration, not as an official-server result.

The current server-benchmark diagnostic reuse run is
`server_eval_opendde_v1_full_msa_template_bf16_h1220_t1220s1`. It reuses 35
existing OpenDDE predictions and is intentionally unranked because it was not
generated as a full fixed-budget server benchmark run. Current
`casp16_server_protein_v1` results:

- protein domain: mean `0.036428` over 71 fixed targets, with 9 scored and 62
  missing predictions.
- protein oligo: mean `0.000000` over 104 fixed targets, with 85 missing
  predictions and 19 `metric_unavailable` rows in the checked-in
  pre-OpenStructure artifacts.

The server baselines remain far ahead: domain server top `110s` has fixed mean
`0.923321` on GDT_TS, and oligo server top `456s` has fixed mean `0.582615` on
QSglob.

The best current local full Protenix server-domain run is
`server_protenix_yang_terminal_tag_cleanup_seed101`, with fixed-set mean
`0.066908`. This is still a failure-level score relative to the official
server top group and should be treated as a baseline for iteration, not as a
competitive result.

## Work Queue

1. Validate OpenStructure `ost` QSglob assembly/chain mapping on server oligos
   where the signal probe found false-zero risk (`H0220`, partial empty chem
   mapping cases such as `T0234O`/`T1249V1O`).
2. Add explicit domain cropping and chain/residue mapping for
   `casp16_server_protein_v2_aliasfix` domain `GDT_TS` scoring.
3. Improve the reference/domain registry for the remaining 96 alias-fixed
   server-benchmark targets that currently lack a cached reference mapping.
4. Add oligo assembly mapping.
5. Queue and score the generated large-target split/fallback policy for the
   eight `n_token > 2560` failures after the active attack job.
6. Re-score current OpenDDE and Protenix-style baselines on the server
   benchmark after the QSglob mapping check, with complete prediction coverage
   rather than local-v1 reuse.
7. Monitor and score `server_attack_protenix_terminal_tag_seed101_105`, the
   first fixed 5-candidate attack run. Keep it separate from `dev_fixed`.
8. Submit `server_protenix_yang_large_target_split_or_fallback_seed101` after
   the active attack job if coverage recovery remains the highest-leverage next
   move.
9. Submit `server_protenix_yang_sequence_recovery_seed101` after the active
   pending jobs if recovering `T1212`, `T1239V1/V2`, and `T2280` looks higher
   leverage than another construct-only run.
10. Submit the stacked
    `server_protenix_yang_sequence_recovery_large_target_fallback_seed101`
    candidate after the active pending jobs if the component coverage fixes
    still look complementary.
11. Submit the token-safe
    `server_protenix_yang_oligo_stoichiometry_token_safe_seed101` candidate
    after the current coverage jobs if exact stoichiometry remains the next
    useful oligo signal.
12. Build public/domain-window experiments for oversize exact-stoichiometry
    systems such as H1258.
13. Run the H1258 target-lab interaction-window job when a small GH200 slot is
    available, then decide whether a target-agnostic window rule is worth a
    full benchmark candidate.
14. Monitor target_lab job `810824` for
    `target_lab/small_complex_stoich_batch_v1`, then inspect predictions for
    exact-stoichiometry and H1258-window behavior before spending full
    benchmark compute. Regenerate `SUMMARY.md` with
    `python target_lab/small_complex_stoich_batch_v1/summarize_outputs.py` and
    diagnostic `DOCKQ.md` with
    `python target_lab/small_complex_stoich_batch_v1/score_dockq.py`.
15. Implement strategy experiments inspired by CASP16 winners: disorder
    trimming, domain decomposition, MSA/template optimization, assembly-aware
    multimer handling, and model ranking.
16. Monitor target_lab job `810862` for
    `target_lab/domain_fragment_batch_v1`, then inspect fragment coverage and
    confidence diagnostics. Promote only a target-agnostic segmentation rule,
    not CASP-domain-summary hand crops.
17. Keep `server_attack_protenix_coverage_stoich_seed101_105` queued as the
    next realistic attack-budget candidate. Submit it only when
    `./casp16 run-next --benchmark casp16_server_protein_v1 --dry-run` selects
    it, or intentionally supersede it after the component single-seed coverage
    runs report negative evidence.
18. Done: created `casp16_server_protein_v2_aliasfix`; future serious
    winner-comparison runs should target it or a newer explicit server
    benchmark version.
19. Monitor and score Slurm job `810938`
    (`server_v2_protenix_yang_coverage_stoich_seed101`) after the active v1
    attack job finishes. This is the first v2 `dev_fixed` baseline and should
    be scored before launching larger v2 attack budgets.
20. Keep `casp16_server_attack_protenix25` as the planned winner-scale upgrade
    path: execute only after `protenix5` and the v2 dev baseline are scored,
    and only as predeclared seed shards.

## Run Discipline

- Use CLI-generated run specs.
- Keep fixed benchmark rules fixed.
- Record hypotheses and knobs before scoring.
- Never use official scores or references to tune target-specific prediction
  behavior.
- Prefer full-benchmark effects over one-off rescue scores.
- Keep `dev_fixed` and `server_attack` results in separate comparisons.
- When reporting progress, always name the budget tier. Do not describe a
  one-seed/one-sample result as winner-comparable.
